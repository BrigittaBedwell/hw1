# ChemE 485 HW1

## Problem 1 (12.10) Process Flow Diagram

Take a flowsheet for one of the processes in Appendix B and identify the reactor feed preparation, reactor, separator feed preparation, separator, recycle, and environmental control sections. Is there any ambiguity concerning the demarcation of these sections? Explain.

## Problem 2 (12.12) Process Flow Diagram

How many simply distillation columns are required to purify a stream containing five components into five "pure" products? Sketch all possible sequences.

## Problem 3 (2.12) Recycle Loops

When considering the evolution of a process flowsheet, it was noted that there are three forms of recycle structure for unused reactants, given as a-c below. For each case, carefully explain under what conditions you would consider or implement each strategy.

a. Separate, purify, and recycle. <br>
b. Recycle without separation and use a purge. <br>
c. Recycle without separation and do not use a purge. <br>

## Problem 4 (2.13) Making a PFD

Acetaldehyde is a colorless liquid with a pungent, fruity odor. It is primarily used as a chemical intermediate, principally for the production of acetic acid, pyridine and pyridine bases, peracetic acid, pentaeythritol, butylene glycol, and chloral. Acetaldehyde is a volatile and flammable liquid that is miscible in water, alcohol, ether, benzene, gasoline, and other common organic solvents. In this problem, the synthesis of acetaldehyde via the dehydrogenation of ethanol is to be considered. The following reactions occur during the dehydrogenation of ethanol:

The single-pass conversion of ethanol is typically 60%. The yields for each reaction are approximately:

1. Acetaldehyde 92%
2. Ethyl acetate 4%
3. Butanol 2%
4. Acetic acid 2%

a. For this process, generate a process concept diagram and show all the input and output chemicals.
<br>
b. Develop two alternative preliminary process flow diagrams **using Visio** for this process. <br>

## Problem 5 (2.14) Process Flow Diagram

Consider the following process in which liquid feed material A (normal BP of 110C) is reacted with gaseous feed material G to produce main product C and by-products R and S via the following reactions:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\*&space;A&plus;G&space;\rightarrow&space;C&plus;S&space;\\*&space;G&plus;C&space;\rightarrow&space;R" title="\\* A+G \rightarrow C+S \\* G+C \rightarrow R" />

Both feeds enter the process at ambient temperature and pressure. Both reactions occur in the gas phase at moderate temperate and pressure (250C and 10 bar). The normal boiling points of G, S, and C are less than -120C. By-product R has a normal boiling point of 75C and is highly soluble in water. Product C is very soluble in water but G and S are insoluble. The single-pass conversion through the reactor is low for feed A and the ratio of G to A in the feed to the reactor should be maintained in excess of 4 to minimize the chance of other unwanted side reactions.

Using this information, and assuming that both A and G are expensive, do the following:

a. Draw a preliminary process flow diagram identifying the main unit operations (reactors, compressors, pumps, heat exchangers, and separators) **using Visio** and identify the recycle structure of the process. <br>
b. Justify the methods used to recycle A and G. <br>
c. What unit operations do you suggest for the separators? Justify your choices. <br>
d. How would your PFD change if the price of feed material G were very low?
